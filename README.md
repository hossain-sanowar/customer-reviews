The KMeans cluster is used to classify this project based on unstructured customer complaint data. This research has received the most input on foreign roaming issues, some of which are calling problems and others billing problems. Individuals may take initiative to address their difficulties with ease after gaining access to these solution patterns. Based on client feedback, this model will be useful for analyzing various industries, such as the health industry, finance sector, and food business.
